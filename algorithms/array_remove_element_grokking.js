Problem 1: Given an unsorted array of numbers and a target ‘key’, remove all instances of ‘key’ in-place and return the new length of the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3, 2, 3, 6, 3, 10, 9, 3], Key=3
Output: 4
Explanation: The first four elements after removing every 'Key' will be [2, 6, 10, 9].
Example 2:

Input: [2, 11, 2, 2, 1], Key=2
Output: 2
Explanation: The first two elements after removing every 'Key' will be [11, 1].
Solution: This problem is quite similar to our parent problem. We can follow a two-pointer approach and shift numbers left upon encountering the ‘key’. Here is what the code will look like:

*/

function remove_element(arr, key) {
    var nextEle = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i ++) {
        if(arr[nextEle] !== key) {
            arr[nextEle] == arr[i];
            nextEle ++;
        }
    }

    return nextEle;
}

const remove_element = (arr, key) => {
    let next = 0;

    for (let i  = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
        if (arr[i] !== key) {
            arr[next] = arr[i];
            next += 1;
        }
    }

    return next;
}
